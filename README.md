Code descriptions
-----------------
First I use pandas to read the csv file and use dataframe in pandas's package to handle the data.
Then create the graph with iGraph model. According to the csv file and create nodes and edges.
Last use the method that iGraph supply to calculate the answer.

Problems when coding

I have try many methods to open the csv file and many models (like numpy,csv,array...etc) to get the data I want.
But still have the formatting problem. Finally I find a project that many help me slove my problem.
